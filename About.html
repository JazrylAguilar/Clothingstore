            As with any place, there are many styles of street fashion in Japan. 
            <br> Some of these styles are extreme and avant-garde, while some are more tame. "Street Fashion" as a concept to be monitored was originally brought to importance by Fruits magazine. 
            <br> This magazine took snapshots of outfits and trends on Japanese streets. Though the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in Tokyo today. 
            <br> Many different styles fit into the general "Japanese Street Fashion" category. </p>
